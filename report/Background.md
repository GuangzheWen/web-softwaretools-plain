# Abstract

A local pet shopâ€™s owner has been working on developing a website to show his available pet . However, lacking enough knowledge of computer technology led him to the failure unfortunately. He would like our team to help him continue his work and complete successfully in the end.

We are interested in the website and trying to make it more appealing and versatile. Besides, we develop an improved graphical user-interface in order to make it more functional to use based on user research.

Our team gave out questionnaires to the customers who are potentially watching his pet shop online at the beginning to find out what they are looking for and what kind of features are mostly wanted.

To maximize the benefits to the pet shop owner, the system is focus on two parts: the need from the owner and the view from customers. As for the owner, he needs the basic operation function upon the website, such as adding, deleting, and editing the information of pets. For the perspective from customers, they want the website has a beautiful UI to give a good impression on them and could be easily used to search their target pets.
