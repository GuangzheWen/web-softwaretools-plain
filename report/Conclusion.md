## Project Objectives

Did we meet our project objectives?

Overall, our team successfully achieved the initial objectives and the project is well done to be given to the owner.

1. Design and build a functional pet shop website with questionnaire

Absolutely, running a survey is a quick and relatively easy way to get data about users. We made a questionnaire and get valuable resutls (you can find them [here](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md#the-answers)), which is essential and important reference of our ground when we make any plans.

Then we follow the four stages below to create the pruduct that delights end-users.

2. Complete essential API and fix bug of operations that return inconsistent results

As mentioned before, the petstore API is imperfect and some operations return inconsistent results, which may lead to limitations, such as we cannot request it to add or change functionality. Moreover, there may also be problems with a large number of people accessing it which results in misplaced data.

We've thought about all these issues in advance and won't really ignore them because they will affect the overall functionality and we can't hide from them.

Features we've added and fixed are described [here](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Background.md#description-of-all-features). Guangzhe brilliantly completed the unit tests for all. See more information in [Testing](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Features.md#testing).

3. Develop a relevant and improved graphical user-interface for users

Of course we have done well in building an improved GUI for buyers and sellers. Enjoy the beautiful interface.

For more information refer to [Final UX](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Front%20End%20UX.md#final-ux).

4. Demonstrate the website is satisfactory and attractive

Success of any software product depends upon the kind of user-experience it offers. We always keep the end-user in mind during the development process. We may develop a totally different system in the future, one criterion that every software is judged upon is whether it is user-friendly, despite having unique functionalities and features.

So we offered our initial website to potential users to collect their opinions and suggestions. Then we discuss their ideas internally. If they are reasonable, we decide to add or modify the sections accordingly. Here are features we added to make the website satisfactory and attractive after the feedback.

- User request to add a search function
- User request to change the search function from an exact search to a fuzzy search
- Post an example of input next to the find box
- FIxed searching input as case insensitive

5. Engage in group work to get skills how to build a user-friendly website with group practice

It is essential for us to understand our development is based on a team if teams to be high-performing. Essential engineering practices are always behind the best software that humanity has produced. In this way, we spend a new section to introduce our group practice. Please click [Group practice](#jump1) for more details.

## Checklist

Broadly, we finished the targets we set before. Every task is achieved with sufficient evidence.

- [x] An interviewer with the owner to learn about his attitudes, ideas, and desires.
- [x] Perform Focus Groups[2] methodology to do user research and form the user stories.
- [x] Take the codebase of the pet store and improve pet store api in need.
- [x] Analyze our site according to the results of user research and the interview with customers and the owner.
- [x] Add essential new features to meet the demands from users.
- [x] Unit testing and integration testing with user input to make sure the website could run correctly.
- [x] Do a survey to find out items need to be improved in the next step.
- [x] Scheduled product delivery and get feedback from users.

# Reflection

The development process has been a valuable learning opportunity for us, and we have learn a lot from this new experience - enjoying developing user-friendly software with others - in this group project, especially affected by the coronavirus pandemic. We totally agree that the creating a positive user experience is the key to developing user-friendly software.

## Group practice

We focused a lot of our energy into engaging in group work with notable challenges, not only coding but also talking to people - the owner, customers and team members. As mentioned, this is a new and changing process for us. Individuals could finish their own coursework on his or her own pace while it is impossible occurred in group working. For teams to be effective, the people in the team must be able to work together to contribute collectively to team outcomes. In other words, in teams, the internal characteristics are the people in the team and how they interact with each other.

Here we would like to display our <span id="jump1">group practice</span>.

### Regular meeting

When our team first got together, we all were confused since we were assigned randomly after receiving the resit email. Gang advised we could have an online meeting to get familiar with each other. But just as Jiangqi once said:" We likely sit around in front of the computers and look at each other, not knowing how to begin in our first meeting." Initially we are not likely a team.

However, team effectiveness is enhanced by daily meeting at the beginning. Over time we were getting to know each other, to know what to expect from each other, and to know how to divide the labor and assign tasks. Through this process, we begin to operate as a team instead of a collection of individuals.

Although we cannot organize daily meeting as planned because of the fact it will affect our normal work progress, we still try our best to have regular meeting which is recorded by Gang in [Process](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md).

### Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily. Luckily, we were committing the work to a version control system during the coding process.

We use GitHub's remote repository to keep our code and we think that GitHub is perfect for team development, where members can share contributions on it. In our opinion, GitHub is more than just a web cloud drive, it is a platform for multiple people to work simultaneously, providing sharing features, version control features, and member contribution statistics.

### User research

To ensure that a new software is successful, the area that developers need to focus on most is user experience. User research is the methodic study of target users so we are able have the sharpest possible insights to coordinate our work to make a user-friendly product.

To maximize the profits of pet stores, we must really understand the needs of users, not only the customers, but also the owner.

Here is a part of our [survey](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md#the-results-of-user-research), for example:

> Questions
> 1. What the most helpful feature do you think when you look for a pet online? (Image, videos, filters, pop up ads, search)
>    If the interview said filters, ask: Can you list some of the filter conditions that you usually use? (tags, categories, status, inventories etc.)
> 2. Do reviews section important for you? Why?
> 3. Which one do you prefer to sign up to use the website? Compulsory or optional? Why?
> 4. What will make you trust the website to add your personal details for signing up? Positive reviews, Best Selling, or More ads and marketing?
> 5. Do you want to see some pets’ food suggestion or other advice for pets? Why?
> 6. Do you recommend any different feature that you think will value the pets shop website?

We chose individuals to have interviews with them and had records of the conversation after permission, which is concluded in [The Answers](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md#the-answers).

During this process, we learned to listen to users’ words in their perspectives, and covered any new problems and spot trends to figure out user stories. The user stories are clear on our [third meeting](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md#meeting-log-1), which is really helpful for us to create software that users find desirable and easy to use.

## Teamwork

### COVID-19 effect

As the coronavirus outbreak has intensified last year, the negative consequential effects begins to appear. Obviously, our team work was affected by the COVID-19, which could be concluded in two aspects.

On the one hand, people can not have a face-to-face talk owning to relevant rules, and some members have returned to their country rather than staying in the Bristol. This increased the cost of exchanging ideas and discussion with team members. Besides, it has presented challenges when we did user research over time through questionnaires.

On the other hand, the pandemic impacted our physical and psychological health indeed. Some left the Bristol and returned to their home may face the self-isolation, which made it more difficult to stay enthusiastic and motivated throughout the project, specially in front of the computer screen for a whole day. Alfymore even felt uncomfortable after vaccine.

Under this difficult period, we have tried our best to tackle the problems. Regular meeting prevented us from feelings of isolation lonely as all group members were able to think aloud study and talk with each other online if he like. If somebody feel uncomfortable today, we'd like to comfort him, persuade him to have a rest with the absence for today's meeting. He will get the information and his assigned task from the meeting log or the chat on Teams.

In a conclusion, COVID-19 cause troubles for us, but we share our feelings and encourage each other to face the problems through this tough period.


### Communication Tools

In spite of covid restrictions and working remotely, we found that our communication channels worked fluently and finished our teamwork after all.

- Microsoft Teams is main communication channels for us to discuss and organize daily meeting. We arrange the regular meeting at proper time in order that everyone could be full of energy to participate it geiven the different time zones.

	<img src="https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/images/Teams.png" width = "30%" />

- Before the meeting starts, each member needs to send his recent progress and discovery to the chat box, so that everyone is familiar with the content in advance. When we are not in meetings, we will also discuss the trivial issues arising from the project in the chat box at any time.

- The questionnaire was designed and shared by Microsoft 365, so we could edit it together and comment whatever we prefer to express own thoughts.

- We use Gantt chart to plan the whole project. Team members could update the actual task start and end times.

- "Technical Log" is necessary to record development process, since other members will have better understanding of the progress.

- Owing to the fact that most of our team members are Chinese, the Chinese use WeChat to share opinions, one kind of immediate communication tool which is popular in China. Although immediate communication sometimes seems to be annoying, but it's quite suitable during short-time development.
