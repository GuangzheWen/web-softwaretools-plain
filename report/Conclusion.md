# Reflection

The development process has been a valuable learning opportunity for us, and we have learn a lot from this new experience - enjoying developing user-friendly software with others - in this group project, especially affected by the coronavirus pandemic. We totally agree that the creating a positive user experience is the key to developing user-friendly software.

## Group practice

We focused a lot of our energy into engaging in group work with notable challenges, not only coding but also talking to people - the owner, customers and team members. As mentioned, this is a new and changing process for us. Individuals could finish their own coursework on his or her own pace while it is impossible occurred in group working. For teams to be effective, the people in the team must be able to work together to contribute collectively to team outcomes. In other words, in teams, the internal characteristics are the people in the team and how they interact with each other.

Here we would like to display our group practice.

### Regular meeting

When our team first got together, we all were confused since we were assigned randomly after receiving the resit email. Gang advised we could have an online meeting to get familiar with each outher. But just as Jiangqi once said:" We likely sit around in front of the computers and look at each other, not knowing how to begin in our first meeting." Initially we are not likely a team.

However, team effectiveness is enhanced by daily meeting at the beginning. Over time we were getting to know each other, to know what to expect from each other, and to know how to divide the labor and assign tasks. Through this process, we begin to operate as a team instead of a collection of individuals.

Although we cannot organize daily meeting as planned because of the fact it will affect our normal work progress, we still try our best to have regular meeting which is recorded by Gang in [Process](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md).

### User research

To ensure that a new software is successful, the area that developers need to focus on most is user experience. User research is the methodic study of target users so we are able have the sharpest possible insights to coordinate our work to make a user-friendly product.

To maximize the profits of pet stores, we must really understand the needs of users, not only the customers, but also the owner.

Here is a part of our [survey](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md#the-results-of-user-research), for example:

> Questions
>
> 1. What the most helpful feature do you think when you look for a pet online? (Image, videos, filters, pop up ads, search)
>
>    If the interview said filters, ask: Can you list some of the filter conditions that you usually use? (tags, categories, status, inventories etc.)
>
> 2. Do reviews section important for you? Why?
>
> 3. Which one do you prefer to sign up to use the website? Compulsory or optional? Why?
>
> 4. What will make you trust the website to add your personal details for signing up? Positive reviews, Best Selling, or More ads and marketing?
>
> 5. Do you want to see some pets’ food suggestion or other advice for pets? Why?
>
> 6. Do you recommend any different feature that you think will value the pets shop website?

We chose some persons to have interviews with them and had records of the conversation after permission, which is conclued in [The Answers](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md#the-answers).

During this process, we learned to listen to users’ words in their perspectives, and covered any new problems and spot trends to figure out user stories. The user stories are clear on our [third meeting](https://github.com/GuangzheWen/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/report/Process.md#meeting-log-1), which is really helpful for us to create software that users find desirable and easy to use.
