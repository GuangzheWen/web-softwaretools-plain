We are intending to indicate the overview of this chapter here at first. This chapter is mainly about features, which are the functions the users will use in the reality. All the features should be created and designed for users, treating users are the center of the whole process. 

The target users of our website are in two separated groups, one is customers group, who are the potential pets-buyers, they are the people who are able to choose online shopping and meanwhile are interested in adopting a pet. The other one should be the pet store host group, or we call it seller. This group probably contains only one person, or perhaps is consist of a couple of members. No matter how many people does it have, it will never have influence on one truth, which is the sellers and buyers must use different features and have to handle problems on different pages.

As above we discussed, our website will be developed by two routes, but synchronized. From the phase of user research, to features choosing, and finally implementing, we are going to keep focus on both two sides. Deciding this working principle have efficiency of development, by avoiding different features for various user groups twisting together, then make the develop process clear, dedicated, and logical. 

Nonetheless, we will definitely not create two websites for two different groups, which looks like a bit counterproductive. Therefore we are preparing to develop a single website which has two mode, switching by a pair of buttons somewhere. In advance of programming we determined that.
