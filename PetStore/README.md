# PetStore

## Instruction

You are likely to **follow** this instructions to run the program.

1. You should ensure that AngularCLI should be installed on your machine.

2. Then in the directory "/PetStore", input command `ng serve --open`  and automatically navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

3. If you encounter error on Terminal at step 2, use this `npm i --save-dev @angular-devkit/core `command then re-try step 2.

4. After ng serve sucessfully, you can see our website running with no pets in database, so the fisrt step should be to add new pets in Seller Mode by clicking button at right-top corner.

   ( We set default state of database is no pets there )

5. To access Seller's pets-managing page, you should know the password, which is "admin".

6. When you try to add Photo URL to a pet, we provide a couple of example URLs here, feel free to take it.
